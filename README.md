# Discord Bot

A Discord Bot that reports if you are connected to a voice channel, who of your friends are online and what they're playing. Also commands like 'mute' and 'move' are possible. Everything works on a Node.js server connected to HomeAssistant via MQTT.
It's also possible to change the _server.js_ to run whatever discord bot you like.
